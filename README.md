WELCOME TO THE BOOKSHELF APP

This is a simple app that acts as a bookshelf for books the user has acquired through available bookstores.

Once logged, the user will be taken to a home page to navigate to the other pages. They can:

1. Look at the books on their shelf
2. Look at the authors avilable, and the books each author has
3. Look at the potential bookstores.

Full CRUD is available for each book by clicking on it and being taken to the edit form.

A user may add a book to the shelf by utlizing the available edit form provided.
